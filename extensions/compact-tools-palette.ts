/**
 * Colors this extension draws with, derived from the active theme rather than named on it.
 *
 * Naming a color does not travel. `borderAccent` is a quiet gray in github-dark-pro and
 * electric cyan in Pi's own dark theme; `dim` is the dimmest name a theme offers yet is
 * still sized for body text, a step louder than a rail should be; and a hard-coded white
 * highlight disappears entirely on a light background. So each value here takes a theme
 * color for its hue and then places it: chrome and the indicator give up most of their
 * saturation and are pulled into a fixed contrast band, while the working label keeps its
 * hue exactly and is moved only in brightness. Everything is measured against the theme
 * background, so the same code reads the same way on light and dark alike: against a light
 * background the moves invert, and standing out means going darker.
